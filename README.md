# University Admission Prediction
This repository contains code for predicting university admission chances based on various features using machine learning models. The dataset used in this project is “Admission_Predict.csv”.

## Introduction

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a student’s admission to a university based on various features such as GRE Score, TOEFL Score, University Rating, and more. We use multiple machine learning models to make predictions and evaluate their performance.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

	•	numpy
	•	pandas
	•	matplotlib
	•	seaborn
	•	scikit-


## Results

We split the dataset into training and testing sets and train multiple models including Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier. We then evaluate their performance.

Logistic Regression:
	•	R-squared score: 0.8060630460887068

Decision Tree Classifier: 
	•	Mean Squared Error: 5.440142918701523
	•	Accuracy: 0.9507733948577994
